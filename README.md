# Morse-Code-Translations

The purpose of this project is to practice using Strings and Arrays in a fun way by translating
Morse Code and returning plain text and vice versa.

A user will input which translation they would like and then enter input requested to be translated. If appropriate input is received the program will provide the translation.
