Morse code, developed in 1832 by Samuel Morse, is one of the most famous of all coding schemes ever developed. Morse code assigns a series of dots and dashes to each letter of the alphabet, each digit, and a few other punctuation characters. The international version of Morse code for alphabetic characters and digits is shown in the table below.

This project involves writing a program to translate Morse code into English and English into Morse code. Your program shall prompt the user to specify the desired type of translation, input a string of Morse code characters or English characters, then display the translated results. The Morse code pattern and English letter translations must be kept and processed using either two one-dimensional or one two-dimensional arrays.

When you input Morse code, separate each letter/digit with a single space, and delimit multiple words with a “|”. For example, - --- | -… . would be the Morse code input for the sentence “to be”. Your program only needs to handle a single sentence and can ignore punctuation symbols.

When you input English, separate each word with a blank space.
